# App.tsx Walkthrough (`src/App.tsx`)

**The one-sentence job of this file:** it is the *root* of the React app — it decides **which page shows for which URL**, and wraps everything in the auth system. Almost nothing in here is unique logic; it's mostly wiring.

The file has 5 chunks, and they're easier to read **bottom-up** than top-down:

| Lines | Chunk | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| 1–16 | Imports | The cast of characters |
| 19–35 | `ProtectedRoute` | The bouncer — kicks logged-out users to `/login` |
| 37–51 | `StudentProgressData` | A type label (shape of analytics data) |
| 54–672 | `StudentProgress` | A full page that lives here (oddly — see quirks) |
| 674–730 | `AppRoutes` | **The URL → page table. The most useful part.** |
| 732–752 | `App` | The outermost wrapper (providers) |

---

## Start at the bottom: `App` (lines 732–752)

```tsx
<AuthProvider>          ← makes login state available to every component
  <Router>              ← enables URL-based navigation
    <AppRoutes />       ← the actual pages
    <Toaster ... />     ← popup notifications (the little toast messages)
  </Router>
</AuthProvider>
```

**Key React idea — components nest like boxes.** Each tag here is a component wrapping the ones inside it. Anything *inside* `<AuthProvider>` can ask "who is logged in?" via the `useAuth()` hook (see [[Frontend Auth Flow]]). Anything inside `<Router>` can navigate between URLs. That's why these sit at the very top: **wrappers grant abilities to everything inside them.**

`index.tsx` renders `<App />` once, and this tree is the entire application.

---

## `AppRoutes` — the page map (lines 674–730)

This is the table of contents for the whole app. Each `<Route>` says: *when the browser URL is X, render component Y.*

| URL | Component (file) | Protected? |
|---|---|---|
| `/login` | `Login` (`pages/Login.tsx`) | No |
| `/signup` | `Signup` (`pages/Signup.tsx`) | No |
| `/` | redirects → `/dashboard` | — |
| `/dashboard` | `Dashboard` (`pages/Dashboard.tsx`) | ✅ |
| `/skill-matrix` | `SkillMatrixCreator` | ✅ |
| `/skill-assignment` | `SkillAssignmentInterface` | ✅ |
| `/progress` | `StudentProgress` (defined in this file!) | ✅ |
| `/settings` | `Settings` (`pages/Settings.tsx`) | ✅ |
| `/badges-test` | `StudentBadgesTest` | ✅ |
| `/badges/:studentId` | `StudentPublicBadges` | **No — public on purpose** |

Things to notice in the code:

- **The protected routes are triple-wrapped:**
  ```tsx
  <ProtectedRoute>   ← must be logged in
    <Layout>         ← adds the nav bar / page frame (components/Layout/)
      <Dashboard />  ← the actual page content
    </Layout>
  </ProtectedRoute>
  ```
  Same nesting-grants-abilities idea as `App`.
- **`/badges/:studentId`** — the `:studentId` part is a *URL parameter*: `/badges/abc123` renders the page with `studentId = "abc123"`. This route has **no** `ProtectedRoute` because it's the shareable public badge page — anyone with the link can view it (it calls the public endpoint in [[Frontend API Layer]]).
- **`<Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />`** — visiting `/` just bounces you to `/dashboard`. There is no homepage.

---

## `ProtectedRoute` — the bouncer (lines 19–35)

Small but important. Read it as three cases:

```tsx
const { isAuthenticated, loading } = useAuth();   // ask AuthContext: who's here?

if (loading)          → show a spinner   // still checking the stored JWT
if (!isAuthenticated) → <Navigate to="/login" />  // not logged in: bounce
otherwise             → {children}       // logged in: show the real page
```

**Key React idea — `children`.** When you write `<ProtectedRoute><Dashboard /></ProtectedRoute>`, the `<Dashboard />` arrives inside `ProtectedRoute` as a prop called `children`. "Return `children`" means "render whatever I was wrapped around." That's how one bouncer guards every page without knowing what the pages are.

The `loading` case exists because on page refresh, the app needs a moment to verify the stored JWT with the backend (see [[Frontend Auth Flow]]) — without it, you'd get bounced to login for a split second on every refresh.

---

## `StudentProgress` — a full page living in App.tsx (lines 54–672)

This is 90% of the file's length and the **least** important part to read line-by-line today. It's the instructor's "Student Progress Tracking" page (`/progress`): pick a course → see a table of students, their top skills, risk levels, and a per-student detail popup.

Skim it for the *patterns*, which repeat in every page of this app:

**1. State variables (lines 55–62)** — each `useState` is one piece of memory the page tracks; when any of them changes, React re-draws the page:
```tsx
const [courses, setCourses] = useState([]);          // dropdown options
const [selectedCourse, setSelectedCourse] = ...      // which course is picked
const [studentData, setStudentData] = ...            // the table data
const [loading, setLoading] = ...                    // show spinner?
const [error, setError] = ...                        // show error box?
const [showModal, setShowModal] = ...                // is the detail popup open?
```

**2. Effects (lines 65–74)** — `useEffect` = "run this code when something happens":
```tsx
useEffect(() => { loadCourses(); }, []);              // [] = once, when page opens
useEffect(() => { ... }, [selectedCourse]);           // re-runs when course changes
```
Together: *page opens → fetch courses → user picks one → fetch that course's students.* This chain is THE core React data-fetching pattern — see [[React Concepts]].

**3. Fetch functions (lines 76–158)** — `loadCourses` / `loadStudentData` follow the same recipe every time: `setLoading(true)` → call the API (from [[Frontend API Layer]]) → `setStudentData(...)` → `setLoading(false)`, with `catch` setting the error message. Note line 110: the raw API response gets *transformed* (top-3 skills computed, defaults filled in) before being stored.

**4. Conditional rendering (lines 177–671)** — the big return block looks scary but it's just *if-shaped UI*. The page shows different things depending on state:
```
loading?                     → spinner
error?                       → red error box
no courses?                  → "configure Canvas token" prompt
students exist?              → summary cards + table + skill distribution
course picked, 0 students?   → "Complete Setup Steps" checklist
showModal?                   → student detail popup
```
Each `{condition && (<div>...</div>)}` means "render this only if the condition is true." The `className="..."` strings everywhere are [[Tailwind CSS]] — styling, safe to ignore while learning logic.

**5. Rendering lists (line 382)** — `studentData.students.map(student => <tr>...</tr>)` = "one table row per student." `.map` is how React turns arrays into UI, always with a `key`.

---

## ⚠️ Quirks worth knowing

- **`StudentProgress` doesn't belong here.** Every other page lives in `pages/` or `components/`; this one is inline in App.tsx, making the file ~750 lines instead of ~80. Likely just history, not intent. Moving it to `pages/StudentProgress.tsx` would be a nice cleanup task.
- **Lazy API imports** (lines 79, 100, 221): `const { instructorAPI } = await import('./services/api')` imports the API module *at call time* instead of at the top of the file. Unusual style — everywhere else uses normal top-of-file imports. Works fine, just inconsistent.
- **The Sync Now button (lines 217–267)** has the most "real" logic in the file: it calls `instructorAPI.forceSyncCourse`, and if the backend answers `202` ("accepted, still working"), it *polls* — re-fetches the data every 15s for a minute so results appear as the background sync finishes.
- Commented-out code at lines 430–436 — dead, ignore.

## Check yourself (answer in your own notes)

1. A logged-out user types `/dashboard` in the browser. Trace exactly what happens and which component makes the decision.
2. Why does `/badges/:studentId` skip `ProtectedRoute`? What feature would break if you added it?
3. What's the difference between `useEffect(..., [])` and `useEffect(..., [selectedCourse])`?
4. When the user picks a different course in the dropdown, list the chain of events that ends with the table re-drawing.

**Next file:** [[Frontend Auth Flow]] covers `AuthContext.tsx` — where `useAuth()`, `isAuthenticated`, and `loading` actually come from.
